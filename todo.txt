For 1.0.0
=========



_version -> auto optimistic locking

PrePersist & PostPersist, PreLoad & PostLoad (better names?), configure via a Facet Interceptor -> tie in with Entity mixin?



For Future
==========
Config option:
Optimise MongoDB Storage by inspecting literal values and NOT storing default values (if the type is not-nullable).
e.g. Bool -> false
	 Int  -> 0
	 List -> [,]
	 Map  -> [:]
Turn off by default -> It is too finicky, and unexpected behaviour. (But I'm sure I saved that total of 0!!!)
Needs to be handled both *to* and *from* Mongo.



Just Plain Bad Ideas:
